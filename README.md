Its not that, it been a long time since these deadly wind disaters trembled India nor is it that there are no existing solutions for timely detection of these disasters.
However all the current existing solution are based on a large scale through the meteorogical departmnet reports or an individual has to be dependent on the internet to have access of the weather apps in their cell phones, moreover there do not exist any alarming systems except for the social media and the news platforms to inform the innocent citizens about the same.

Platform:        Android Application.
Mobile features: GPS.
                 Microphone.
Database:        Amplitude-frequency characterstics.                 

We as team Oxyrich aim at a detection cum alarming system, to detect and alarm the fellow beings timely of any foresight wind disaster.The insights that make our system unique from other existing solutions is that this system could be accesible offline along with the fact that any individual having this application installed in its cell phone could detect the wind speed at an individual level, and rest else of alarming will be taken care of by the application itself.
To implement our plan we will be using the microphone in the cell phone, which will measure(amplitude and frequency) the noise of the wind and based on the frequency and amplitude analysis of the signal through an inbuilt database(amplitude-frequency characterstics) it will be able to compute the speed of the wind.
Moreover if any disaster is forseen in near future all the people having the application installed in their cell phone will get an emergency alarm to be careful of the foreseen casulty that may occur.The indepth information of the wind i.e. the direction etc can be calculated using the Doppler's Effect analysis.
For the alarming part we will be using the apk(GPS) to have information of all the users in the affected region and alarm them.
(GPS chip can determine its location offline).

Thus enabling the user to have make measurements and analysis of the winds and letting the users to be least concerned about any coming disaster since GPS too doesn't need an internet connection, our application will work without internet.


Our application could also be used as a substitute for speedometer, measuring the wind throwing speed of an euipment etc.
